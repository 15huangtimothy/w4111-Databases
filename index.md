__Note:__ This GitHub repository supports the Dept. of Computer Science, Columbia University course
_COMS W4111-Introduction to Databases_. The current content is for
the [Spring 2019 semester,](https://courseworks2.columbia.edu/courses/79571/wiki) section 03, H03, V03, 
taught by Donald F. Ferguson.

# W4111 - Introduction to Databases

## Overview

From the CU course description, 

"The fundamentals of database design and application development using databases: entity-relationship modeling, logical design of relational databases, relational data definition and manipulation
languages, SQL, XML, query processing, physical database tuning,
transaction processing, security. Programming projects are required."

Sections 03, H03 and V03 of _W4111 - Introduction to Databases_ focus on understanding and applying database technology, 
and deemphasizes the theory and algorithms. The course will cover underlying theory and algorithms
but in less detail than other database sections at CU. The course will have for modules, each of which has
sub-modules. 
Specific topics will often appear in more than one sub-module of a module and across modules. 
For example, understanding data modeling and best practices, and data schema/query are intertwined. The modules
and sub-modules are listed below.

## Prerequisites

The CU course description lists the following prerequisites:
- _COMS W3137 -- Honors Data Structures and Algorithms_ or _W3134 -- Data Structures in Java_
- Fluency in Java
- Instuctor's permission.

A course in data structures is helpful for sections 03, H03 and V03 but not essential.

Java is an excellent language for learning algorithms, data structures and programming fundamentals. Sections 03,
H03 and V03 will use Python for examples. Python is recommended for homework assignments and exams.

## Sections and Registration

There are 3 sections for Spring 2019, _COMS W4111 - Introduction to Databases_,
sections 03, H03 and V03.
The three sections __cover the same material, have the same homework assignments and exams, 
have the same office hours and
have the same teaching assistants/course assistants.__ 

Section 03 is the "classic," in-person lecture format. H03 is a "hybrid section."
Students do not need to attend the lecture and can watch recordings of the lectures. V03 is via the [Columbia Video
Network.](https://cvn.columbia.edu/) Schools and departments have policies about elibility for the various sections,
enrollment authorization and waitlist management. Jessica Rosa in the CS department manages the enrollment and
waitlist. Please contact Jessica if you have questions. 

Students in all three section can access the lecture videos.


__Module I: Foundational Concepts__

1. Introduction to databases, role in applications, type of DB applications and overall system software architecture.

2. Information and data modeling and best practices, focusing on supporting application scenarios.

3. Relational data model (theory), Relational Database Management Systems, Structured Query Language, data query and update scenarios.

4. Extended topics in SQL and RDBMS (performance, security, constraints, triggers, connection management, etc).

__Module II: Database Management System Implementation/Architecture__

5. Storage management, disk management, buffer management, indexes.

6. Query processing and optimization:  Query evaluation, query parsing and parse trees, operator implementation algorithms, query rewrite, query optimization techniques.

7. Concurrency control and transaction management.

__Module III: NoSQL Database Overview__

8. Overview, graph databases, Redis.

9. Amazon S3, Amazon DynamoDB, Google Firebase/Cloud Firestore.

__Module IV: Decision Support, Data Analysis__

10. Overview of schema denormalization, OLAP cubes, data analytics, machine learning.

## Lecture Material

Lectures are Thursdays from 7:00 PM to 9:30 PM. Each session is the equivalent of two lectures. Lecture material
is below. Lecture material will typically be some combination of
[iPython/Jupyter Notebook,](https://jupyter.org/) HTML version of the
notebook and/or PDF of a PowerPoint presentation.
