XXXX XXXX XXXX says they are a Debt collector - acting for another ( another 3rd party - XXXX XXXX as Trustee of a Trust ) -- and the Debt was under Dispute however XXXX continued to make efforts to collect on a debt claimed as owed and instructed a 3rd party named XXXX to publish private NON Public Information. XXXX states they ONLY do as instructed by Nationstar however Nationstar knows this was &quot;&quot; in dispute &#x27;&#x27; as still open dispute ongoing concerns that were raised and not answered previously. Nationstar continues to just disregard homeowner &#x27;s concerns. Stating they would look into the facts however never responds knowing this was a heightened and very wrong to publish NON Public information. Now further sends a new RMA yet never responds to the RMA that is provided and or all the documents provided. Each  communication is ignored unless I bring to the Regulators Attentions. Then still typically are answered with non-answers. Or by passing the details raised. &lt;P/&gt;Each communication is met with incompetent staff that seems any issues are out of their league or scope of comprehension. The internal staff keeps changing my One Pointed assigned person back and forth and back and forth. No Customer Escalation Teams are available when they state to contact them. Each attempt to reach out only results in new frustrations. No return calls or no responses to my concerns raised. Each time a new person at Customer Service says they will put notes and have the Escalation Team look into and also have the one person call back and no calls ever come. No Escalation Team answers. In the hurry to foreclose regardless of all concerns in regards to my unconscionable predatory loan by XXXX and many promised outcomes from each regulatory lawsuit that was to assist only results in ever new increased balances that have no relation to the agreements made. This has caused extreme harassment and unfair business practices. I feel my money was stolen and I can not even use my home from now it is damaged so badly after Nationstar ordered persons to break in and cause massive damages. This has been non stop. I deserve better treatment and respect than what is shown. My privacy should be protected and not part of a scheme to cause further embarrassment and harassment. &lt;P/&gt;This is a pattern which interferes with my entire life as I am strung along waiting for them to make good on the Regulators Agreements pertaining to the USDOJ - and CA AG and the NMS agreements pertaining to my XX/XX/XXXX &#x27; XXXX Origination loans. &lt;P/&gt;The note was accelerated however since no understanding is found at any level - even the Attorney firms hired</td>\n",

I waited there while the machine beeped non stop for about XXXX minutes and the rest of my money never came out. After that I pushed the cancel button and nothing It seemed like the machine was frozen or something. I then see that it refreshed because the screen went all red to how it usually is before it is used. I then checked my account to see if the money actually went in. The only deposit that was posted to my account was the XXXX {$3000.00} and the other {$3000.00} neither came out nor credited to my account. So I called a security which was standing there to see if he knew what I could do he said I should just call the number that is on the ATM machine to have them help me resolve. How I was in a hurry I looked inside to find someone who could help but all the representatives where busy and I knew the wait was going to be long so I just left and called the number right away. I talk to one of the representative on the phone told them what had happened they offered me a temporary credit while my claim was investigated. Then on XXXX XXXX they decided to take back what they had credited because they said that they saw the amount did get deposited. I clearly stated that I did XXXX different deposits that the XXXX did go in and the XXXX did not. So they reopened my claim because they had closed it already because according to them it was resolved and I was lying. The representative then tells me to call back in XXXX hours if I do n&#x27;t see the money back in my account. I waited XXXX hours and nothing so I call them back to see what is happening and they state that the video surveillance does not show me doing XXXX deposits and that they are right and they just shut down my claim so It ca n&#x27;t be reopened. I ask what can I do and they recommend I go to the bank and look for the security who was there when that happened ; I have went and no luck. So I call back on XXXX XXXX for a better understanding of the situation and to see what they investigation relies on I ask to see the surveillance video that according to them does not show me doing XXXX deposits. The representative this time tells me I need a court order to access the video surveillance. I do not know what to do I need my money that is why I sold my car. If I would n&#x27;t of had extra money in my account I would of been in the negative dollars and fees would of started accumulating. I am a college student and a single parent.

I told her I was on my bicycle on my way to pick something up but I would pay it as soon as I was done with that because she also stated that she had a meeting to attend and she would contact me after her meeting to see if I had made the payment already. I at that point was willing to pay the {$880.00} to get the vehicle back with the help of my sister and completely forgetting about the {$150.00} I had worked for the week the vehicle was taken as well as that money.

    "- Relational database engines support additional key semantics and also support _indexes._\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- MySQL supports the following keys/index:\n",
    "    - PRIMARY KEY: Key is unique and NOT NULL. $\\Rightarrow$ Indexed\n",
    "    - UNIQUE: Key is unique or NULL. Multiple rows may have NULL for a value if column definition allows NULL. $\\Rightarrow$ Indexed\n",
    "    - INDEX: Non-unique but indexed for performance.\n",
    "    - FULLTEXT (INDEX) -- Will cover later.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "- In database engines, keys represent/implement\n",
    "    - Integrity constraints. We will cover the concept in detail in future lectures.\n",
    "    - Performance optimization.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "- For now, just think:\n",
    "    - Every table should have a primary key.\n",
    "    - Put indexes on other columns or sets of columns that will frequently be in WHERE clauses.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "- For a table with 1,000,000 rows:\n",
    "    - SELECT without a index examines O(1,000,000) rows.\n",
    "    - SELECT with an index examines O(log(1,000,000)) = 20 rows.\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "- RDB query engine compute a \"cost\" in terms of CPU and disk input/output for relational operations. This is critical to _query optimization,_ which we will cover later. For comparison of the benefits of indexes, the cost of ```select * from people where playerid='willite01'```\n",
