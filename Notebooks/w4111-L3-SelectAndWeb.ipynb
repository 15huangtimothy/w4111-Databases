An entity type could represent a collection of people, places, things, events, or concepts. Examples of entities in an order entry system would include Customer, Address, Order, Item, and Tax. If you were class modeling you would expect to discover classes with the exact same names. However, the difference between a class and an entity type is that classes have both data and behavior whereas entity types just have data. \n",
