    "- How do you identify entity types/entities? From http://www.agiledata.org/essays/dataModeling101.html\n",
    "    - \"An entity type, also simply called entity (not exactly accurate terminology, but very common in practice), is similar conceptually to object-orientation’s concept of a class – an entity type represents a collection of similar objects.  An entity type could represent a collection of people, places, things, events, or concepts. Examples of entities in an order entry system would include Customer, Address, Order, Item, and Tax. If you were class modeling you would expect to discover classes with the exact same names. However, the difference between a class and an entity type is that classes have both data and behavior whereas entity types just have data. \n",
    "    - \"Ideally an entity should be normal, the data modeling world’s version of cohesive. A normal entity depicts one concept, just like a cohesive class models one concept. For example, customer and order are clearly two different concepts; therefore it makes sense to model them as separate entities.\" \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- How do you identity relationships?\n",
    "    - \"In the real world entities have relationships with other entities.  For example, customers PLACE orders, customers LIVE AT addresses, and line items ARE PART OF orders. Place, live at, and are part of are all terms that define relationships between entities.  The relationships between entities are conceptually identical to the relationships (associations) between objects.\"  \n",
    " \n",

    "#### Logical Data Model\n",
    "\n",
    "- The logical data model requires adding:\n",
    "    - Attributes\n",
    "    - Primary Keys\n",
    "    - Foreign Keys\n",
    "    \n",
    "- Identifying attributes (http://www.agiledata.org/essays/dataModeling101.html)\n",
    "     - Each entity type will have one or more data attributes.  For example, in Figure 1 you saw that the Customer entity has attributes such as First Name and Surname and in Figure 2 that the TCUSTOMER table had corresponding data columns CUST_FIRST_NAME and CUST_SURNAME (a column is the implementation of a data attribute within a relational database). \n",
    "    - Attributes should also be cohesive from the point of view of your domain, something that is often a judgment call. – in Figure 1 we decided that we wanted to model the fact that people had both first and last names instead of just a name (e.g. “Scott\" and “Ambler\" vs. “Scott Ambler\") whereas we did not distinguish between the sections of an American zip code (e.g. 90210-1234-5678). Getting the level of detail right can have a significant impact on your development and maintenance efforts. Refactoring a single data column into several columns can be difficult, database refactoring is described in detail in Database Refactoring, although over-specifying an attribute (e.g. having three attributes for zip code when you only needed one) can result in overbuilding your system and hence you incur greater development and maintenance costs than you actually needed.\n",
