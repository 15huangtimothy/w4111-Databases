    "### Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "- This is an _introduction_ to databases. I want to cover\n",
    "    - Several types of data models, and the database systems that implement the models.\n",
    "    - Best practices for modeling and implementing data-centric solutions.\n",
    "    - Different types of application scenarios that rely on databases.\n",
    "    - Interesting topics and challenges in the design and implementation of database.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- There are several (too many) ways to classify applications and scenarios that use databases. Some examples\n",
    "    - One classification approach\n",
    "        - _Batch processing systems,_ where you submit a a bunch of files, a \"job\" containing multiple subprograms, and later receive output in the form of a file.\n",
    "        - _Real-time (online) systems,_ where you submit requests to do a small amount of work that has to be done before some very early deadline.\n",
    "        - _Data warehouse systems,_ where reporting programs and ad hoc queries access data that is integrated from multiple data sources\n",
    "    - Annother classification approach: A data processing system may involve some combination of\n",
    "        - Conversion converting data to another format.\n",
    "        - Validation – Ensuring that supplied data is \"clean, correct and useful.\"\n",
    "        - Sorting – \"arranging items in some sequence and/or in different sets.\"\n",
    "        - Summarization – reducing detail data to its main points.\n",
    "        - Aggregation – combining multiple pieces of data.\n",
    "        - Analysis – the \"collection, organization, analysis, interpretation and presentation of data.\".\n",
    "        - Reporting – list detail or summary data or computed information.\n",
    "    - A third classification approach\n",
    "        - Operational Database\n",
    "        - External Database\n",
    "        - End User Database\n",
    "        - Distributed Database\n",
    "        - Data Warehouse Database\n",

    "\n",
    "### Set Up\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Someone has given you two comma separated value (CSV) files\n",
    "    1. Master -- Information about everyone who has ever played Major League Baseball.\n",
    "    1. Batting -- Information about every player's batting performance for every year.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "1. Answer some interesting and potentially unanticipated questions based on the data. For example\n",
    "    1. Find a player by last name and first name, and display information.\n",
    "    1. Show me all the teams a player played for.\n",
    "    1. Which player who ever played for the Boston Red Sox has the highest career batting average.\n",
    "    1. etc.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "1. Since you have written all this interesting code to _query_ the data, why not make it available on the web?\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "1. Oh. And people are still playing MLB.\n",
    "    1. We need to update the data.\n",
    "    1. Let's allow authorized people to update the files.\n",

    "- We will start with a simple 3-Tier Architecture.\n",
    "- We will start with the data in files, and the use a database system to understand the benefits.\n",
    "- The diagram below shows two \"servers.\"\n",
    "    - There are HW servers, e.g. computers with disks attached to the network.\n",
    "    - Long running software programs executing in OS processes and listening on network connections.\n",
    "    - In our scenarios, there will typically be one HW server (your laptop) and multiple SW servers. In the real world, there are dozens, hundreds, thousands of HW servers and complex mapping on SW servers to HW.\n",
