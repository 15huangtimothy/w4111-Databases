XXXX XXXX XXXX says they are a Debt collector - acting for another ( another 3rd party - XXXX XXXX as Trustee of a Trust ) -- and the Debt was under Dispute however XXXX continued to make efforts to collect on a debt claimed as owed and instructed a 3rd party named XXXX to publish private NON Public Information. XXXX states they ONLY do as instructed by Nationstar however Nationstar knows this was &quot;&quot; in dispute &#x27;&#x27; as still open dispute ongoing concerns that were raised and not answered previously. Nationstar continues to just disregard homeowner &#x27;s concerns. Stating they would look into the facts however never responds knowing this was a heightened and very wrong to publish NON Public information. Now further sends a new RMA yet never responds to the RMA that is provided and or all the documents provided. Each  communication is ignored unless I bring to the Regulators Attentions. Then still typically are answered with non-answers. Or by passing the details raised. &lt;P/&gt;Each communication is met with incompetent staff that seems any issues are out of their league or scope of comprehension. The internal staff keeps changing my One Pointed assigned person back and forth and back and forth. No Customer Escalation Teams are available when they state to contact them. Each attempt to reach out only results in new frustrations. No return calls or no responses to my concerns raised. Each time a new person at Customer Service says they will put notes and have the Escalation Team look into and also have the one person call back and no calls ever come. No Escalation Team answers. In the hurry to foreclose regardless of all concerns in regards to my unconscionable predatory loan by XXXX and many promised outcomes from each regulatory lawsuit that was to assist only results in ever new increased balances that have no relation to the agreements made. This has caused extreme harassment and unfair business practices. I feel my money was stolen and I can not even use my home from now it is damaged so badly after Nationstar ordered persons to break in and cause massive damages. This has been non stop. I deserve better treatment and respect than what is shown. My privacy should be protected and not part of a scheme to cause further embarrassment and harassment. &lt;P/&gt;This is a pattern which interferes with my entire life as I am strung along waiting for them to make good on the Regulators Agreements pertaining to the USDOJ - and CA AG and the NMS agreements pertaining to my XX/XX/XXXX &#x27; XXXX Origination loans. &lt;P/&gt;The note was accelerated however since no understanding is found at any level - even the Attorney firms hired</td>\n",

I waited there while the machine beeped non stop for about XXXX minutes and the rest of my money never came out. After that I pushed the cancel button and nothing It seemed like the machine was frozen or something. I then see that it refreshed because the screen went all red to how it usually is before it is used. I then checked my account to see if the money actually went in. The only deposit that was posted to my account was the XXXX {$3000.00} and the other {$3000.00} neither came out nor credited to my account. So I called a security which was standing there to see if he knew what I could do he said I should just call the number that is on the ATM machine to have them help me resolve. How I was in a hurry I looked inside to find someone who could help but all the representatives where busy and I knew the wait was going to be long so I just left and called the number right away. I talk to one of the representative on the phone told them what had happened they offered me a temporary credit while my claim was investigated. Then on XXXX XXXX they decided to take back what they had credited because they said that they saw the amount did get deposited. I clearly stated that I did XXXX different deposits that the XXXX did go in and the XXXX did not. So they reopened my claim because they had closed it already because according to them it was resolved and I was lying. The representative then tells me to call back in XXXX hours if I do n&#x27;t see the money back in my account. I waited XXXX hours and nothing so I call them back to see what is happening and they state that the video surveillance does not show me doing XXXX deposits and that they are right and they just shut down my claim so It ca n&#x27;t be reopened. I ask what can I do and they recommend I go to the bank and look for the security who was there when that happened ; I have went and no luck. So I call back on XXXX XXXX for a better understanding of the situation and to see what they investigation relies on I ask to see the surveillance video that according to them does not show me doing XXXX deposits. The representative this time tells me I need a court order to access the video surveillance. I do not know what to do I need my money that is why I sold my car. If I would n&#x27;t of had extra money in my account I would of been in the negative dollars and fees would of started accumulating. I am a college student and a single parent.

I told her I was on my bicycle on my way to pick something up but I would pay it as soon as I was done with that because she also stated that she had a meeting to attend and she would contact me after her meeting to see if I had made the payment already.

I was told by my credit card company that they were reporting it to all three credit bureaus every month and that I should contact Experian, and file a dispute with the credit card company to have it thoroughly investigated, which I did both. When I initially contacted Experian I was told that they had no record of my XXXX credit card account, so I needed to contact XXXX. At that time I submitted the dispute form to the credit card company, XXXX, and I received communication that they were accurately reporting to all three credit bureaus and that I should contact Experian. Today, XX/XX/XXXX, I contacted Experian again after noticing that my XXXX credit card account still has not been displayed on their report. I was told this time, that the account was removed from my credit profile, by Experian. I was told that it was an internal policy that they remove any accounts that has potentially negative information for anyone who is listed as an authorized user. Experian proceeded to explain that if there were no negative marks on the account, in my case one 30 day late payment reported in XX/XX/XXXX, they would keep the account displayed on my credit report. I was told by Experian that if I was added as a joint member on the credit card, all of the credit history with it would return to my Experian credit report. This seemed to be an easy fix, but my credit card company enforced a policy, without notifying consumers, that they will no longer provide joint credit accounts, and this attempt was failed when I reached out to my credit card company. <br>With this internal policy that Experian has, I find it unfair, contradictory, and untruthful. What this policy allows is for authorized users to take credit for positive behavior that &quot; does not belong to them &#x27;&#x27; when good marks on accounts are posted.

My issues with them first started in my senior year of college, spring of 2017. XXXX XXXX repeatedly called and demanded I begin to pay back one of my loans, despite the fact that I was still in school. I explained this was not possible due to that fact, and that I had chosen deferment until after graduation for all my loans. XXXX XXXX claimed I did not, and continued to harass me. They stated there was 1 loan, out of 5, that I had selected to pay while in my last semester. I told them that was a mistake, and that it didn&#x27;t make sense given my other loans would not be touched until after graduation. They refused to work with me, and the loan started to build interest. After graduation, I began to pay as I could. I started working, but not a well paying job. I have made {$35000.00} a year since graduation in upstate New York. I still live at home with my parents due to this. Since graduation, XXXX XXXX has been nothing but uncooperative. They have raised the interest rates on each of my loans over 2.5 % over the past 18 months, and have set payment at 60 % of my monthly income. They demanded I pay {$1200.00} a month, despite the fact I only made {$2000.00} after taxes. This did not include the fact that I live an hour away from where I work ( 40 miles ) and was often stuck working weekends with no extra pay,  therefore gas costs also piled up along with my monthly car payment of {$400.00}. I have repeatedly asked XXXX XXXX to work with me, and they have refused. It has reached a near crisis point several times, with me falling into delinquency and them repeatedly asking me to pay more than I even make at that point ( i.e. asking me to pay all {$3500.00} I owe at once ). It reached its worst point yet this month when I learned I was losing my job at the end of the month. I called and requested to work with XXXX XXXX, when I told them I was losing my job on XX/XX/XXXX they said &quot; how will you continue to pay us? &#x27;&#x27; and &quot;&quot; why are you calling if not to make a payment? &#x27;&#x27; They did not offer to work with me.

The man I spoke to, XXXX XXXX, asked me to verify the day I was born and the very last digit of my social security card. I gave him the information because I didnt think he could do anything with such a small amount of information and told him I went into the bank and was told and given evidence that this debt does not exist. He asked who I spoke to, and when, and asked if i went into the branch physically. I said I spoke to a teller about 30 minutes prior to the phone call, and went to the physical location. I was a bit angry because I know I have never been sent to collections, and could not tell me any details on this apparent debt I owed. He said he needed to contact the issuer who gave him my case and that he would call me back. It has been over 24 hours and I have not received a call back from him.

We didn&#x27;t have the {$1300.00} at that very moment, but we could work out a payment plan and eventually even out that credit impact. They said no, and said that they took my unwillingness to pay the entire sum now as a rejection of my obligations and that they will move forward with legal action to obtain their funds.

At the time of payment, the checking account had more than {$25000.00} in available funds. USAA &#x27;s payment services advised upon payment that it may take up to 3 days for payments to process and clear. All three payments cleared my XXXX account on XX/XX/XXXX. USAA gave me credit for the {$3000.00} payment and the {$2200.00} payment, but decided to place a hold on the {$10000.00} payment for one week.

We applied initially for Care Credit a few years ago to help us when we run into the occasional incidents where we have medical, dental, or veterinary expenses that exceed our out-of-pocket financial abilities at that time and the cards are used VERY rarely, MAYBE once every 1-2 years. Anyway, we received two cards from Synchrony/Care Credit that we believed to simply be replacements for our existing cards. The cards had the standard stickers on the front to call and activate them, so I did so and did not encounter anything that seemed out of the ordinary or unusual from any other time I&#x27;ve ever received new cards from any other bank/credit card institution. I believe that the new cards were just that, new cards ( possibly with an increased spending limit, I don&#x27;t recall ). In the past when I&#x27;ve encountered such circumstances with other such credit companies ( like XXXX XXXX ), a new card or an increase in spending limit does not equate to a whole new account being opened. However, today I received notice from XXXX XXXX ( via a feature that I use to monitor changes in my credit ) that a new account had been opened in my name and it had adversely impacted my credit score. Upon review, Synchrony/Care Credit had closed my prior account with them and had opened a whole new account for me and my husband when I activated the new card. The closing of one account and opening of another dropped our credit scores. I immediately called the credit bureau ( XXXX, in this case ) and reported this issue as a dispute on both of our credit reports. At the advice of the credit bureau, I also called Synchrony/Care Credit to ask why they had closed my old account and opened a new one as opposed to just giving me the new card/increasing my limit on my old account. I was advised, basically, that they had sent me fine print or a &quot; disclosure &#x27;&#x27; that had informed me this is what they would do. Respectfully</td>\n",

As usual I logged onto my app and initiated a payment by selecting my landlord &#x27;s email address on the list of contacts. On the night of XX/XX/2018, she contacted me to advise that she never received the funds. I looked in my list of transactions and the money was taken out. I looked further on the list of XXXX transactions and realized it indicated that the funds went to an unknown individual. I called the bank and they opened up an investigation. The investigation then resulted in them claiming that I initiated the transaction by entering this unknown individual &#x27;s XXXX digit telephone number. I advised them that I did no such thing and this has to be some type of fraud where someone intercepted this transaction. I appealed the decision which resulted in them claiming that I mistakenly inputted the phone number. I appealed it again as I&#x27;ve only sent transactions with email addresses and individuals that I know who are on my contact list. I&#x27;ve visited 2 branches and tried to get help with no luck. I tried calling the unknown individual when this all started with the advise of the citibank rep who opened up the initial investigation. I spoke to the woman who claimed that she had 3 bank accounts and she would have to check each one. While on the phone with her she checked her Citibank account and her XXXX account. She said no funds came in. She then strangely said that her third bank account with Bank XXXX XXXX was recently closed and that is the bank that is associated with the phone number I called her on. She then went on to say that the phone she picked up was her daughter &#x27;s. She said she would confirm and get back to me. She never got back to me and after the first appeal with Citibank I went to a branch in XXXX, NY. While with the bank rep we attempted to call the number together only to discover that the phone number was disconnected. On XX/XX/2018 during my second appeal, I requested the documentation from the first investigation.

At that time they indicated that the amount outstanding was XXXX, with a loan total of over XXXX. which was noted as late charges on our account. ( Since purchasing this vehicle it should also be noted we have had to spend almost XXXX on repairs to the vehicle which were due to know manufacturing defects in this vehicle when sold to us by our dealer and are having these claims investigated and has cause a larger financial strain on us. ) Once the Bankruptcy was filed, the account was shut down online with no access even to my non filing spouse, there were no statements, no verbal communication, or other contact via mail to my non filing spouse. NO payments would be accepted and the auto pay feature that we had set up was shut down so no payments were taken for 10 months. We had been advised by our attorney to set up the auto pay feature to our loan so that they payments would continue, however Ally shut the entire account down. They would not discuss the account due to the claim in the bankruptcy courts and the auto stay. <br><br>Fast forward to XX/XX/XXXX, We woke to tail lights in our driveway on XX/XX/XXXX. The were repossessing the vehicle in my husbands name. A phone call was made to ALLY bankruptcy solutions and I requested information as to why the car had been removed from my driveway. I was met with a very rude, and dismissive female by the name of XXXX who advised me that we were 274 days late with payments ( payments they would not allow us to make, or discuss, and had not withdrawn based on the auto pay set up ) I inquired as to why there was no communication of balances dues, statements being sent, no communication related to the non filing spouse my husband. She very rudely and demeaning voice she told me I should consult my attorney because I obviously did not understand the bankruptcy stay rule, and when I pointed to the fact that my husband who was the primary on the account was not the one filing bankruptcy, she advised that the consider the contract as ONE contract, and that because of the bankruptcy stay, that she again told me I must not understand and should contact my attorney about did not enable them to contact, send statements, or take payments from us. The stay on the vehicle was lifted on XX/XX/XXXX per XXXX this is the day they received notification. She stated that her department had attempted to reach my husband regarding the vehicle on two different occasions, however we did not receive the phone calls, and explained to her the phone calls were not received. I inquired as to why they had not sent a letter by regular mail, or certified mail, as they had shut down the account, and not communicated with my husband in any way. She became even more belligerent and yelled at me telling me that I obviously didn&#x27;t understand the bankruptcy laws on the &quot; stays &#x27; and that it was our tough luck if we didn&#x27;t get the calls.

I was then to pay {$320.00} per month. Each and every month XXXX began charging me for excessive amounts up to {$580.00} per month and no justification for increase. This was a XXXX XXXX XXXX.I was constantly overcharged repo my car once by error and they kept my money. Also several times charging me numerous late fees up 3 times in one month. They kept on over billeing me I kept paying them then finally they threaten to repo and they came and took car while I was asleep, gave me no notice to claim car back they kept car and money. I then moved to XXXX, ca and while there a year, or more I could not commute then moved to my mothers house. One day I received a note from a forwarded mail, saying I was going to jail if I did not pay them from XXXX office i called and spoke with a rep who threatened me and cursedme out. I then called the sherriffs they said no knowledge of any warrant in their database none existed. Just last week I found out a bench warrant issued for XXXX in court which I had not been served. I worked 12 hour shifts and was not living where they claimed they served me. They lied to court commited perjury against me. I then discovered warrant has been issued in XX/XX/XXXX. yet XXXX harassed me way before then, told me pay or they were putting me in jail. Discovered recently that a judgement had been issued for {$2000.00}. Then, K street Finance never heard of them reports that I owe them apparently they are affiliated with XXXX but my contract is XXXX. They gave me eraseable ink contract now saying {$14000.00} was original amount when XXXX was correct amount. Their judgment was issued while I was not notified of court. Also after they recieve judgement they applied for 4 insurance clsims that I put in for to repair they paid deductible then applied the money to lan never fixing the truck, they rceived over {$5000.00}. They owe me. they refuse to stop reporting on my credit even told XXXX  and bureaus I requested a credit line and I did not and the began reporting thta I owe {$5000.00}. to them nd they wrote XXXX off and they collected XXXX in insurance after the judgment under my name. They also are in a clss action named XXXX Vs, &gt; K street finance regarding illegal repos. They then began not serving individuals and getting automatic judgements to prevent members from claimimg money from class action lawsuit. I am sick of them reporting bad info on my credit I have disputed them over 10 times and they keep adding money to my account increasing balance and interest is wrong also. They took insurance meant for car repair and kept and applied to loan. before the repo they took one payment for bumper damage of {$600.00} did not fix vehicle. I am tired please stop them from doing this to me and others. XXXX XXXX is located in XXXX XXXX, CA nothing but crooks. They also force placed insurance 2 policy yearly in one year and over chged me again</td>\n",

I was supposed to receive XXXX at closing for using this lender because I receive closing costs for having a XXXX loan. He has received my paystubs for the past 5 months and has my offer letter when I started my new job In XXXX. Yesterday he called me to say I was not going to get the XXXX  loan or the XXXX at closing because I worked some overtime and went over the income limit. I told him why he didnt say anything about the limit since he has been receiving my paystubs for 5 months. He said he didnt know I was hourly! He has my job offer letter! He didnt even look at my paystubs once before yesterday. He also said he was late to request the appraisal and and would not have closing docs ready for XX/XX/XXXX. I already had those XXXX compromised to pay back a loan of XXXX I did to pay an account. I have to pay it back after closing. I also have a large number of contractors scheduled to do extra painting, install blinds, deliver furniture, washer dryer that I cant cancel. This lender has not been accountable at all. I am renting and have to leave my apartment on the XXXX. He just said I can have an FHA loan but dont get my money and have higher interest. He screwed me so bad I dont know what to do.</td>\n",

My credit score was NOT an issue when I approached XXXX of OGI Mortgage Bankers, for the Equity Line of Credit request. I approached XXXX for an Equity Line of Credit because I was looking to invest in property within the next 8 months. I wanted to pay off my current debt to raise my credit profile so that I could invest. <br>2. XXXX began the process to re-finance my property because he said it was a quicker and surer way to resolve debt and raise my credit profile to expedite investment opportunities. <br>3. My credit and/or score was NOT mentioned as a problem to secure the re-finance. My outstanding student loans was mentioned as a factor. <br>4. When XXXX failed, to his own written admission, to provide what he promised, I requested him to cease ALL loan processing. <br>5. I secured an Equity Line of credit loan ( as initially requested ) within 3 weeks by XXXX XXXX XXXX. <br>6. XXXX was negligent, unprofessional, and dishonest. This has negatively impacted my credit.

I am being sent to a warrior transition unit due to injuries I sustained during XXXX XXXX in the military. I emailed US military lawns asking permission to bring the car to my new duty station. I was told by XXXX XXXX that I would need to sell the car back to the dealership that I purchased it from and I wouldnt be allowed to bring the car with me. I have never missed a payment or been late. XXXX  reasoning for not allowing me to bring the car with me is because of my DEROS this was not part of the contract. I sold the car back to deal at a lost of XXXX. I also put down XXXX at time of purchase I would have almost paid off all of the car after paying all this including my payments I have made. I want us military loans to refund me the XXXX down payment and pay off the remaining balance as they didnt honor their contract. I cant afford this I have to purchase a car now so I can get to medical treatment for my injury. I cant believe a company for the military would treat a XXXX like this.</td>\n",

       "        <td>On XX/XX/2018 I refinance a personal loan with cash security in XXXX Oklahoma on XX/XX/XXXX I dropped off the check before opening for my payment. A 10-day grace period is given by the company before a late fee is charged and this is the first time in the 10 loans I&#x27;ve had with them that I have been close to being late. On Wednesday I noticed that the check hadn&#x27;t cleared my bank and contacted my bank and they let me know that the funds had been taken out on Tuesday for another bill and that that check was going to be returned so I had my father go in and make the payment that Wednesday the company got the check returned Thursday XX/XX/XXXX and the system gave me both a late fee and a returned check fee I asked the lady if there was anything I could do to get the late fee removed since I had never had one and had been a good customer for several years .she said there wasn&#x27;t anything they could do. I made my principal payment of XXXX on time in XX/XX/XXXX plus another {$3.00} towards the late fee I asked the lady if I could carry it over until the next month and that I would take care of the rest of the late fee then and she assured me that that would be fine a week later I got a call from the lady at cash security asking when I&#x27;d be able to take care of the rest of the {$40.00} that is due and I told her that I planned on taking care of it when I made my payment in XX/XX/XXXX she said okay but yet then again a few days later I got another call from the lady at cash security just to let me know that the {$40.00} had went up to {$60.00} I asked her what happened and she didn&#x27;t know so we had to get ahold of the Regional manager that explain to me that their system didn&#x27;t put my payment towards the principal. It had first taken care of the late fees so I got another late fee because of the principle that was left die. No one told me that&#x27;s how their system worked. It isnt stated in the contract and no one informed me that I would receive another late fee on my late fee. I got a hold of the regional manager again and try to get the mailing address for the main office that I told was in XXXX XXXX but they never would return my calls. I have been a very good customer for them for a long time now and it bothers me to think that they&#x27;re doing this to other people. they had several opportunities to inform me that I would receive a late fee and that my principal wasn&#x27;t taken care of when I made my principal payment. In my opinion this practice of theirs is extremely unethical. On top of the confusion and the Shady practices I&#x27;ve been receiving letters saying they don&#x27;t know why I&#x27;m behind and text messages from this company although I&#x27;ve asked them not to text me and had set up a payment for XX/XX/XXXX already</td>\n",

They gave me a total of XXXX. I questioned the amount being so high and asked if I was getting credit for the 2 insurances they added to the loan and was told I was getting credit. I called the insurance company to inquire on what the refund would be and was told that I had to request a cancellation through the loan company and they would reimburse me the money. I called Lenco and asked for a printout that showed a breakdown on how they were calculating the payoff amount and was sent a printout that only showed the amount of XXXX as payoff. No indication of how this amount was calculated. I know it was a high interest loan but I knew I would be paying the loan off early to avoid the high interest charges.

       "        <td>I received a letter from a company called XXXX XXXX. In their letter, they stated they participate in the VA IRRRL Streamline Program. They stated in their letter that they do not require a credit score, appraisal fee, or a proof of income. When I called them I was told they do not require these things because it was satisfied when I received the initial mortgage through my original VA Loan that it was a program to refinance my mortgage at lower rates specifically designed to help veterans. I was then asked for my current mortgage lender &#x27;s information and asked to verify my address. From this point, the representative ( XXXX ) told me she would send this to a loan officer and I would hear back from someone on Monday. By Wednesday I called back because nobody had reached out to me and there was no answer so I left a voicemail. By Friday, nobody had called back so I called again. This time I was told I would be turned down because my credit score was too low to get a better rate. At no time did I authorize this company to run my credit because on their letter that they mailed to me it clearly stated the credit score was not needed to participate in this program. I asked the representative how this could happen and she apologized for the misleading letter and said it must be a typo. Furthermore, the credit score they said I had is not the same score that I see when I look at all three credit bureau reporting agencies, the score they reported was substantially lower by more than 50 points. I told her I found this was unacceptable and reported it to the Texas State Attorney &#x27;s Office and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.</td>\n",

They have called sometimes twice a day using four different numbers which I have searched online and have come back with their information. <br>Here are the numbers : - XXXX ( XXXX ) XXXX - XXXX ( XXXX ) XXXX - XXXX ( XXXX ) XXXX - XXXX ( XXXX ) XXXX I had answered one call from them, however they would not identify who they were and why they were calling without me verifying who I was, and I will not identify myself because of all the scams that are going around. Also, it is my understanding that they must identify who they are and why they are calling. <br><br>I received a letter dated the XX/XX/XXXX, but the letter was not received until the XXXX, but they started calling on the XXXX. It my understanding that they can not call you before the letter is received. <br><br>My debt was originally through XXXX XXXX/MCSB. I had been in contact with them and made a {$30.00} payment to MSCB on Friday XX/XX/XXXX. I received the letter Saturday XX/XX/XXXX and was unable to contact either place of business because they were closed. XXXX called Saturday the XXXX at XXXX EST , which was XXXX their time. They close at XXXX on Saturdays, which only gave me a window of 13 minute to call them back. Which I would have, if I had received the letter before that time. <br><br>I called MCSB today ( XX/XX/XXXX ) to ask if my account had been transferred to XXXX and they had no knowledge of this and had not received word from the hospital to close the account. They were going to look into it and I am going to call them back tomorrow ( XX/XX/XXXX ) to find out what the outcome is. <br><br>I then called XXXX today to explain the situation. They were trying to argue that they had purchased the account and that MCSB was lying to me and to not believe them. I tried to explain to them that I had just talked to MCSB and paid them a {$30.00} payment Friday. They refused to listen to what I had to say and kept trying to argue with me that I didnt know what I was talking about and that MCSB was lying. They also tried to say that the debt was from XX/XX/XXXX, which technically it is, but that is after fighting with the hospital for three years to change a procedure code and I went from owing $ 4000+ to {$600.00}. <br><br>I also told them I was going to report them to the XX/XX/XXXX  because they were harassing me with phone calls which is illegal, along with not identifying who they were when asked. I told them to stop calling and they calling me another time today. <br><br>They transferred me to a supervisor, which took 10 plus minutes and I feel I was just talking to the same person because she started with one accent and switched halfway through to the accent of the person I had originally talked too. <br><br>I also told them that I couldnt afford their ridiculous payment plan which was either ~ {$200.00} for 3 months or a one lump sum of ~ {$480.00}. They asked how much I could pay and I told them about {$30.00} a month and they asked if I wanted to set up a payment plan, I told them not until this confusion gets resolved and she hung up on me.</td>\n",

Properly create a new escrow account by failing to estimate disbursement amounts using reasonable judgment based on information reasonably available or known to it. The amount of real estate taxes which we, as purchasers and borrowers, would be obligated to pay upon closing was a readily known amount. The tax could have been easily determined at the time of the initial loan disclosure and certainly by the time of closing/settlement by a simple check of the public record by the settlement agent or the lender. The amount is determined by multiplying the sale price of the home ( which was known by Lender ) by the applicable tax rate, which is public record. Under Kentucky law and based upon information readily available in the public records of XXXX County, Kentucky, the real estate taxes which should have been disclosed to us totaled {$8500.00}, but the settlement agent and the lender reported the taxes as only {$4100.00}. They simply stated the taxes paid by the PRIOR owner, which under Kentucky tax law is not a justifiable, reasonable, or good faith statement of the taxes which we would be paying or in compliance with federal regulations [ Regulation X 1024.17 ( 7 ) and Regulation Z 1026.39 ( g ) ( 3 ) ] The Lender and the settlement agents negligence or failure to comply with federal regulations resulted in a drastic shortage in the escrow account and has caused us a great deal of financial hardship. Had we been informed by the initial disclosure of what the taxes would be and therefore the escrow amount, we could have shopped around more and perhaps found a lender with a lower rate or lower closing costs. <br><br>The closing agent ( Lawyers Title of Cincinnati Inc. ) failed to accurately disclose the taxes that you would be paying and which would be used to calculate your escrow account</td>\n",

       "        <td>Last XX/XX/XXXX, we went to XXXX XXXX XXXX located at XXXX, PA. We were invited by our friend through their Referral process and ultimately bought an empty lot ( see XXXX ). It was a good sales presentation knowing that it is a vacation resort and has some amenities good for family and friends. We were induced because we were made to believe that their were a lot of buyers whom have settled some home/lots and also a good investment in longer term in terms of selling it in the future. The fact that it&#x27;s a sweet sales talk and make financial investment sense, we were able to purchase it and we can cancel it within 7 days based on the initial verbal contract which we honor because we like the offer. But after a year and realizing that there are some of other XXXX communities and other XXXX communities who have made to believe with the same marketing/sales techniques, the value of the land is less worth than the original investment. <br><br>We went back after a year to disclose our intention of selling it, but we were made another alternative offer since the process of selling it would go thru a long process of selling, foreclosure. And thus, we were made an alternative good offer of selling our 0.5 hectare vacant lot into an interval ownership ( called timeshare ). See XXXX. <br>I really don&#x27;t have idea of timeshare but since we were made to believe that we can enjoy vacationing and can use XXXXXXXX XXXX especially the newly constructed one, we can enjoy it a yearly 7 day vacation without paying anything except for the annual association fees.Plus the fact, that the payment will be significantly lower payment. We were also told that we can earn by renting out the interval to any vacationers which we did but never had any successful turnout except for only two days rent. We were also made to believe that we can sell it quickly in the market because there are high demands. The fact that these are good deals that we have to take it since we can enjoy vacationing plus the investment/quick sell turnaround.<br><br>After a year or two, we realized in XX/XX/XXXX that there are really no demand for the eagle rock resort timeshare, and thus we can&#x27;t even enjoy the new townhomes promised to us. On XXXX, XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, 6 separate letters were sent to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX respective address to ask for remediation and assistance on my concern to discontinue/sell my timeshare. <br>See XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX for Certified Receipts. I had already thrown or lost some of the receipts but these were the one that I was able to keep inside my wallet. <br><br>On XX/XX/XXXX, finally, UEMC on behalf of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, they have responded. They have responded with a vagued and misleading references. <br>1st. - The 7 days contract we were informed in our timeshare. Should they have informed us, we could have cancelled it right away after selling our mortgage contract.<br><br>2nd. - The response was based on the lot that was previously sold and not the interval ownership program.<br><br>3rd. - There is no way of knowing whether your property is being listed to sell whether online or by calling the XXXX XXXX XXXX prescribed in the letter. <br>4th - After careful research, we found out that there a lot of overage 5-7 years timeshare/vacation lot which you can search from XXXX/XXXX/XXXX/XXXX   that has been listed and renewed.</td>\n",

None of us were informed by the lender or XXXX XXXX that our payments would be going up. Seeing as they are the preferred lender for XXXX XXXX they have done numerous mortgages here in XXXX county, it is implausible that they did not have a better idea as to what the tax rates should be. I believe this was done purposely in order to have buyers qualify for higher mortgages and to help sell more houses for XXXX.

       "        <td>I believe my lender is in violation of several parts of the Dodd-Frank Act and possibly the Truth in Lending/RESPA Acts. Please note that this information has been filed with both agencies and Congresswoman XXXX. I have outlined what I have been able to find as far as these Acts are defining as law/regulation and what my lender/servicer has done in my situation. I have been unable to find or pay an attorney ti help me so I am relying on the CFPB to research this further as to additional violations, possibly usury as my interest rate jumped to 18 % for the last 2 years and as a whole may be at a rate higher than the legal 18 % due to the fees that are also considered part of the interest in figuring the actual interest rate for usrary. I have a Private lender, who used a broker to find the loan and I did not previously know, and understand to being doing business as a mortgage lender, and I entered into a residential owner occupied mortgage on XX/XX/XXXX<br><br>120 Day Rule : I received a letter from my lender in on XX/XX/XXXXstating that my XX/XX/XXXX payment check had been ret unpd and that I needed to pay XXXX by XXXX XXXX   XX/XX/XXXX I was instructed that if I did not pay the amount due by the end of XX/XX/XXXXthat I would be in default and foreclosure would begin. On XXXX XXXX a complaint was filed and summons issued to start the foreclosure. By law my lender, also servicer as he receives payments, is required to wait 120 days to begin foreclosure. He did not. Had the foreclosure not began, the complaint filed, prior to the 120 days I certainly could and would have gotten caught up. I qualified for gov&#x27;t funding that would pay my arrears and make 1 yrs pymts ( both with caps ) if my lender agreed to consider a loan mod at the end of a year ( not nec make one ) and he refused to take the money. I also qualified for it inXX/XX/XXXXand again he refused when contacted by the FL Hardest Hit Fund.<br><br>Responsibility to provide foreclosure options : He is also supposed to provide information in writing in regards to my options prior to or to prevent foreclosure. I believe within 45 days of default. He did not.<br><br>Required to be licensed ( servicer ) : I believe under the same law as a servicer and person that accepts payments he is required to be licensed. He is not.<br><br>Required to be lkcensed ( lender ) : i am a littlenunclearnif he falls in the category for this under Dodd-/frank, but from what I can deciminate, he does need a license due to the nature and status of occupancy ( re o/o ) of the loan. He is not, he was and it went inactive for onne adress and was revoked at anther address. It appears he had 2 locations but now operates out of his home.<br><br>Duty to provide accounting : As a servicer he is required to provide certain information within a specified period of time when requested in writing, he has failed to do so. I was not given a statement of interest pd forXX/XX/XXXX or XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX statement was requested and not provided for almost 2 weeks.<br><br>i have never been provided with the amount of prinicipal and interest is in each payment.<br><br>XX/XX/XXXX I sent a letter via email to my lender and his attorney outling what I saw as some options. I asked him to please reconsider the FL Hardest hit fund money ; outline the parameters so he understood that he would not ever be required to modify my loan ( which he aditmently says he does not have to and will not do ), just agree to consider doing so. Then they can move forward with final approval and loan signing, which would give my lender a check for the arrears ( catch me up ) and make my payments for 1 year. In the same email, I also asked for a payoff amount to pay off before the sale and a new payment amount if I reinstate my mortgage and resumed payments as he had stopped the escrow account for taxes and insurance which i had been paying sinceXX/XX/XXXX. I had to send a second request onXX/XX/XXXX 14 days later, to which I received a reply the same day. I believe that response tonthe initial request should have happened in 5 days. For a reply, all I was sent was a response to one of my requests ; the minimum amt being accepted in the auction sale amt. No payment amt, nothing about resuming escrow/new payment amt monthly, and no response to anything else, my options I outlined. I believe by law he has a duty to provide a response and he did not.<br><br>Interest Rate ( includ fees ) no higher than 18 % : My loan is currently at an interest rate of 18 % due to default. That was not disclosed to me, except in the terms of the agreement I signed. I do not believe that most people read every word of every document in that paperwork and an interest rate like that should be clearly defined and stated, even separately in writing, which it was not.<br><br>Predatory Lending.<br><br>Initially I thought my lender was being very fair and I understand the need to move forward at some point to keep the process moving. However at several points throughout this process there were violations and blatant refusals of moneys that would have pulled my loan out of default. There were offers made by my lender that were not followed through on, correspondance that should have been acknowledged and responded to was not, and win win solutions were ignored. That seems predatory to me, to some attorneys I spoke to and most are outraged at the 18 %. I would ask that the CFPB look into that and determine as they feel necessary as to if it is or is not. An example of an offer made : I was given an agreement to stop the auctionXX/XX/XXXX and when I attempted to meet the conditions by securing a buyer and providing a purchase agreement offer for approval, along with securing an escrow account for a deposit, he responded with needing to consult his attorney in the am and then one of them would respond. No one responded and no one returned my many emails or phone calls and messages left beginning mid morning the next day when I hadn&#x27;t heard anything from he or his attorney. I even sent a signed copy along with escrow funding information by mid afternoon. I heard nothing. The sale went thru. That sale was reversed due to a bankruptcy, and there is another sale date.<br><br>I was unaware of these things until the FL Hardest Hit Fund informed in early XX/XX/XXXX of this year after again contacting him about accepting the funding I qualified for, informed me he was unlicensed. I questioned the validity of my mortgage if he was unlicensed and a series of phone calls got me looking into some things online. After it appeared to me that there were some violations, I tried to find an atty who could verify this for me. Finding an attorney who knows the specific laws is difficult and finding one to speak to me due to the late nature of the case is next to impossible. I just 2 days ago spoke to an atty who indicated baes on his initial questions that had these things/violations been raised in XX/XX/XXXX orXX/XX/XXXX, there would have likely been a trial scheduled, rather than default judgement granted. I could not afford an attorney and was trying everything to remedy the situation but did not know about these laws. Hard as I tried and as many case or online files I scoured it took a while to put this all together and make sense of it then verify legally. I and the attorneys who have spoke to me agree there is a case to file civil and reverse the sale we are not sure we can file the information quick enuff to stop the sale, but could have if a little more time.<br><br>Point is these laws are in effect to protect me and even without the specific law numbers a lawyer would submit there are some laws that were not followed and I just want to be protected and not lose my home but remedy this instead. I can and will pay this mortgage off if this sale can be postponed. The new buyer and I have contacted the lender and asked or 10 days more to get paperwork done with pre-approval and documentation, maybe even escrow. He denies it. I understand his position but i have tried to remedy this in every way possible without much leeway or working with me from my lender and even disregard to my questions and suggestions or when seeking options. I just want to be protected by these laws if entitled, which it appears I am. I have a private residential owner occupied loan and those are governed by the Dodd-Frank Act, RESPA and the Truth In Lending Act. Even if noted in my mortgage document or note as something different than the law, it should not be legal to verbally or even in writing break that law and have the document be binding. I cant sign away my right to other laws, why would I be able to sign this one away. These violations should be looked into and enforced and I should be granted any action I am entitled to as a result of these violations if the CFPB determines there in fact are violations.</td>\n",

When clicking on XXXX XXXX XXXX the loan number ( picture XXXX ) was different than the one on Loan Estimate. So, I did not proceed. <br><br>Today ( XX/XX/XXXX ), XXXX XXXX forwarded me an email from XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ). XXXX claims that the loans are the same, however, he attached a screen shot ( picture clarification ) which seems to show that they are not. Note that this picture shows two different loans : 1 ( float ), 2 ( LE locked ). I think I was emailed 2 but I was asked to sign 1. <br><br>I am not in mortgage business. This could be either blatant attempt at fraud or just clumsy way of accounting. I got other offers which were much more transparent. Can you clarify this ( if Trump did n&#x27;t fire you yet )? <br><br>Thanks</td>\n",

       "        <td>This is the second complaint I am filling for this company. The original complaint number is XXXX. Originally I was working with Option Funding on refinancing my home loan. We told them that we wanted a loan with the terms that we pay twice a month rather than once a month. This would reduce our principle faster so our 30 year loan would be paid off early. They agreed to find us a loan with these terms. Once we signed on the loan we found out that the loan was not set up this way and the lender would not make this change since this requirement was not stated in the terms of the loan. I informed XXXX XXXX at Option Funding and they said they would call the mortgage company to fix this. They said I could just make an extra payment at the end of the year but this is not what we agreed to when we signed up for the loan. During this time the original mortgage company sold the loan to another company who stated they would not make any changes to the loan since the terms were already set. Option Funding said they would try with the new company but never got back to me and is no longer taking my calls. <br><br>The from the company through CFPB response was not true as they never contacted me about any offer of refinancing on this loan and never mentioned a bi-weekly payment center. Also this was a by monthly request at the beginning of the loan process and they agreed to find one like that. I reached out to the loan office repeatedly as did my relator with no response.</td>\n",

My card was not supposed to be charged for 6 days from the date of account creation yet I was charged immediately where upon I informed them that I wanted to cancel and get a refund as they did not follow through with their promised action. To date I am still waiting for my money back. I have called them and they claim it is the bank holding my money in a pre-authorization state. The bank claims it is them and that it would fall off after a week yet it has now been over two weeks.I also called and cancelled the credit reporting service that was a mandatory purchase for their service yet is a separate company.I plan to continue calling both parties- the bank and sky blue but judging by their actions so far it would appear like they have better interests than giving me my refund.</td>\n",

I have been the victim of harassment, predatory lending practices, and unfair and deceptive trade practices at the hands of Instacredit Automart. An auto sales dealership in the state Illinois. I am requesting that this contract and all amendments thereafter be thrown out or null with all payments you have received for the said contract be returned to me in full. I am arguing several reasons that I feel this is a practical request. First, I was misinformed about the value and history of the vehicle. I was not informed that the vehicle was previous used as a rental for a rental business. Had this been disclosed, as required by law, I would not have agreed to the purchase of the vehicle. I have only recently become aware that my rights as consumer, per the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Mandated by the FTC, have been violated. <br>The first complaint I have actually occurred on XX/XX/XXXX, but was only recently made evident during a phone call conversation I had with XXXX during XX/XX/XXXX. I asked her if I could have my sentimental belongings back that were inside the vehicle when it was previously missing from my apartment complex parking lot unbeknownst to me, XXXX stated that my belongings were destroyed after only three weeks of being in the companys possession. This is a complete violation of Illinois state consumer financial protection law. Most of the items were sentimental and are therefore irreplaceable in monetary value. This is disheartening and has caused a great deal of grief. <br>My second complaint has to do with the companys debt collection practices. As I feel that these too have violated my rights. They were both harassing and deflating to my character per several witness accounts. When a friend of mine, who luckily happens to be a licensed financial adviser, decided to help me get the loan made current, she was shocked because the collections representative XXXX made derogatory statements that were defalcating to my character! <br>As upset as I was still seeking to bring my loan current. I was denied any correspondence from company that they claimed was sent to me and I had never received. I was then transferred to the supervisor XXXX of their legal department. I calmly relayed my concerns of the full obligation not being satisfied upon return or repossession of the vehicle, as the value of the vehicle only covers approximately 10 % of the actual {$10000.00} purchase price. This is without the preposterous 25 % interest rate that I am currently being charged. I was only XXXX years old when I signed the contract last year and admit I had no idea what the given interest rates were had it been through an unaffiliated, more prominent lending source : such as a bank or a credit union. I was not provided with any 3rd party interest rates and was made to believe that XXXX XXXX XXXX, the companys subsidiary, was my only option for financing. This being said, and the fact only their company benefited from this, there is no denying that I have been taken advantage of and this company has committed unfair and deceptive trade practices as well as unfair and deceptive lending practices. Had I been presented with interest rate options that should have been legally made available to me perhaps this would have been a purchase that I could have afforded and not defaulted on. After informing XXXX of the XXXX XXXX XXXX quote of ~ {$1000.00} on the vehicle, in which he replied, I could sell this car for much more than the actual value to another buyer, I am certain repossession is not an uncommon practice for your company. However, this is an unfair trade practice and harmful to any consumer. There were also witnesses to this conversation that are willing to testify.</td>\n",

       "        <td>XX/XX/XXXX, I contacted my credit card company to inquire as to why my Experian credit report failed to show any record of my credit card account that was opened in XX/XX/XXXX and is still open to date. I was told by my credit card company that they were reporting it to all three credit bureaus every month and that I should contact Experian, and file a dispute with the credit card company to have it thoroughly investigated, which I did both. When I initially contacted Experian I was told that they had no record of my XXXX credit card account, so I needed to contact XXXX. At that time I submitted the dispute form to the credit card company, XXXX, and I received communication that they were accurately reporting to all three credit bureaus and that I should contact Experian. Today, XX/XX/XXXX, I contacted Experian again after noticing that my XXXX credit card account still has not been displayed on their report. I was told this time, that the account was removed from my credit profile, by Experian. I was told that it was an internal policy that they remove any accounts that has potentially negative information for anyone who is listed as an authorized user. Experian proceeded to explain that if there were no negative marks on the account, in my case one 30 day late payment reported in XX/XX/XXXX, they would keep the account displayed on my credit report. I was told by Experian that if I was added as a joint member on the credit card, all of the credit history with it would return to my Experian credit report. This seemed to be an easy fix, but my credit card company enforced a policy, without notifying consumers, that they will no longer provide joint credit accounts, and this attempt was failed when I reached out to my credit card company. <br>With this internal policy that Experian has, I find it unfair, contradictory, and untruthful. What this policy allows is for authorized users to take credit for positive behavior that &quot; does not belong to them &#x27;&#x27; when good marks on accounts are posted. This policy also allows for authorized users to not be held responsible for the account when negative marks are made because it &quot;&quot; does not belong to them &#x27;&#x27;. In my situation</td>\n",

My issues with them first started in my senior year of college, spring of 2017. XXXX XXXX repeatedly called and demanded I begin to pay back one of my loans, despite the fact that I was still in school. I explained this was not possible due to that fact, and that I had chosen deferment until after graduation for all my loans. XXXX XXXX claimed I did not, and continued to harass me. They stated there was 1 loan, out of 5, that I had selected to pay while in my last semester. I told them that was a mistake, and that it didn&#x27;t make sense given my other loans would not be touched until after graduation. They refused to work with me, and the loan started to build interest. After graduation, I began to pay as I could. I started working, but not a well paying job. I have made {$35000.00} a year since graduation in upstate New York. I still live at home with my parents due to this. Since graduation, XXXX XXXX has been nothing but uncooperative. They have raised the interest rates on each of my loans over 2.5 % over the past 18 months, and have set payment at 60 % of my monthly income. They demanded I pay {$1200.00} a month, despite the fact I only made {$2000.00} after taxes. This did not include the fact that I live an hour away from where I work ( 40 miles ) and was often stuck working weekends with no extra pay,  therefore gas costs also piled up along with my monthly car payment of {$400.00}. I have repeatedly asked XXXX XXXX to work with me, and they have refused. It has reached a near crisis point several times, with me falling into delinquency and them repeatedly asking me to pay more than I even make at that point ( i.e. asking me to pay all {$3500.00} I owe at once ). It reached its worst point yet this month when I learned I was losing my job at the end of the month. I called and requested to work with XXXX XXXX, when I told them I was losing my job on XX/XX/XXXX they said &quot; how will you continue to pay us? &#x27;&#x27; and &quot;&quot; why are you calling if not to make a payment? &#x27;&#x27; They did not offer to work with me.

She suggested that I call the toll-free number on the card, and nobody answered. I left a message and received a call back a few minutes later. The man I spoke to, XXXX XXXX, asked me to verify the day I was born and the very last digit of my social security card. I gave him the information because I didnt think he could do anything with such a small amount of information and told him I went into the bank and was told and given evidence that this debt does not exist. He asked who I spoke to, and when, and asked if i went into the branch physically. I said I spoke to a teller about 30 minutes prior to the phone call, and went to the physical location. I was a bit angry because I know I have never been sent to collections, and could not tell me any details on this apparent debt I owed. He said he needed to contact the issuer who gave him my case and that he would call me back. It has been over 24 hours and I have not received a call back from him.

We didn&#x27;t have the {$1300.00} at that very moment, but we could work out a payment plan and eventually even out that credit impact. They said no, and said that they took my unwillingness to pay the entire sum now as a rejection of my obligations and that they will move forward with legal action to obtain their funds.

I was told by my credit card company that they were reporting it to all three credit bureaus every month and that I should contact Experian, and file a dispute with the credit card company to have it thoroughly investigated, which I did both. When I initially contacted Experian I was told that they had no record of my XXXX credit card account, so I needed to contact XXXX. At that time I submitted the dispute form to the credit card company, XXXX, and I received communication that they were accurately reporting to all three credit bureaus and that I should contact Experian. Today, XX/XX/XXXX, I contacted Experian again after noticing that my XXXX credit card account still has not been displayed on their report. I was told this time, that the account was removed from my credit profile, by Experian. I was told that it was an internal policy that they remove any accounts that has potentially negative information for anyone who is listed as an authorized user. Experian proceeded to explain that if there were no negative marks on the account, in my case one 30 day late payment reported in XX/XX/XXXX, they would keep the account displayed on my credit report. I was told by Experian that if I was added as a joint member on the credit card, all of the credit history with it would return to my Experian credit report. This seemed to be an easy fix, but my credit card company enforced a policy, without notifying consumers, that they will no longer provide joint credit accounts, and this attempt was failed when I reached out to my credit card company. <br>With this internal policy that Experian has, I find it unfair, contradictory, and untruthful. What this policy allows is for authorized users to take credit for positive behavior that &quot; does not belong to them &#x27;&#x27; when good marks on accounts are posted. This policy also allows for authorized users to not be held responsible for the account when negative marks are made because it &quot;&quot; does not belong to them &#x27;&#x27;.

My issues with them first started in my senior year of college, spring of 2017. XXXX XXXX repeatedly called and demanded I begin to pay back one of my loans, despite the fact that I was still in school. I explained this was not possible due to that fact, and that I had chosen deferment until after graduation for all my loans. XXXX XXXX claimed I did not, and continued to harass me. They stated there was 1 loan, out of 5, that I had selected to pay while in my last semester. I told them that was a mistake, and that it didn&#x27;t make sense given my other loans would not be touched until after graduation. They refused to work with me, and the loan started to build interest. After graduation, I began to pay as I could. I started working, but not a well paying job. I have made {$35000.00} a year since graduation in upstate New York. I still live at home with my parents due to this. Since graduation, XXXX XXXX has been nothing but uncooperative. They have raised the interest rates on each of my loans over 2.5 % over the past 18 months, and have set payment at 60 % of my monthly income. They demanded I pay {$1200.00} a month, despite the fact I only made {$2000.00} after taxes. This did not include the fact that I live an hour away from where I work ( 40 miles ) and was often stuck working weekends with no extra pay,  therefore gas costs also piled up along with my monthly car payment of {$400.00}. I have repeatedly asked XXXX XXXX to work with me, and they have refused. It has reached a near crisis point several times, with me falling into delinquency and them repeatedly asking me to pay more than I even make at that point ( i.e. asking me to pay all {$3500.00} I owe at once ). It reached its worst point yet this month when I learned I was losing my job at the end of the month. I called and requested to work with XXXX XXXX, when I told them I was losing my job on XX/XX/XXXX they said &quot; how will you continue to pay us? &#x27;&#x27; and &quot;&quot; why are you calling if not to make a payment? &#x27;&#x27; They did not offer to work with me.

She suggested that I call the toll-free number on the card, and nobody answered. I left a message and received a call back a few minutes later. The man I spoke to, XXXX XXXX, asked me to verify the day I was born and the very last digit of my social security card. I gave him the information because I didnt think he could do anything with such a small amount of information and told him I went into the bank and was told and given evidence that this debt does not exist. He asked who I spoke to, and when, and asked if i went into the branch physically. I said I spoke to a teller about 30 minutes prior to the phone call, and went to the physical location. I was a bit angry because I know I have never been sent to collections, and could not tell me any details on this apparent debt I owed. He said he needed to contact the issuer who gave him my case and that he would call me back. It has been over 24 hours and I have not received a call back from him. Today I did some research and found his business online, but the address does not match the address on the letter, nor does the address on his website match a legitiment address on XXXX maps.

We didn&#x27;t have the {$1300.00} at that very moment, but we could work out a payment plan and eventually even out that credit impact. They said no, and said that they took my unwillingness to pay the entire sum now as a rejection of my obligations and that they will move forward with legal action to obtain their funds.
